   <li>With the help of your group tutor via the forums, modify the object oriented (OO) version of the MusicLibrary so that it reads song data from a file.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

You can create a plain text file named ‘songs.csv’ where each song’s data are stored in the following format on separate lines:

&lt;song title&gt;,&lt;song location&gt;

Where &lt;song title&gt; is a particular Song object’s title and &lt;song location&gt; is that same Song object’s location.

To achieve this, create a method named ‘loadSongs’ where you read songs.csv one line at a time and create new Song objects as you go. Think of an appropriate way to invoke/call this method and do so.

<ul>

 <li>With the help of your group tutor, create a method named ‘saveSongs’ which will save all of the Song objects in the format given in</li>

</ul>

5.1 above, to the ‘songs.csv’ file. Find out if you would overwrite the file or if you would update the file.

5.3. (Optional) Do the same for Renovation Project Manager.
